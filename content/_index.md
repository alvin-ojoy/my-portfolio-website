Hey there!

A self-taught DevOps enthusiast with an AWS certification and a passion for building scalable, efficient systems. My journey started in telecoms engineering, where I developed a knack for problem-solving and infrastructure—skills I now channel into cloud technologies and automation.

When I’m not architecting pipelines or tinkering with IaC, I run a YouTube channel exploring filmmaking and videography. Storytelling through code and cameras? That’s my kind of workflow.

Let’s connect—whether it’s about cloud tech, CI/CD, or the perfect camera gear!
