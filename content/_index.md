<!--Hey there! I'm Alvin

A self-taught DevOps enthusiast with passion for building scalable, efficient systems. My journey started in telecoms engineering, where I developed a knack for problem solving and infrastructure skills I now channel into cloud technologies and automation.

When I’m not architecting pipelines or tinkering with IaC, I run a YouTube channel exploring filmmaking and videography. Storytelling through code and cameras? That’s my kind of workflow.

Whether it’s about cloud tech, CI/CD, or the perfect camera gear. Let's connect!-->
